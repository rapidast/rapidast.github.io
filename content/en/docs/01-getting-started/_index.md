## Quickstart
Quickly setup RapiDAST to scan a target application. See [Workflow](#workflow) for more information.

1. Create a minimal config file for the target application, see [Configuration](../02-how-tos/configuration-overview) section for details
2. Run RapiDAST with the config file, either in a container or from source code

## OS Support
Linux and MacOS are both supported, however running RapiDAST in a container is currently only supported on Linux. See MacOS Configuration section for more details.
